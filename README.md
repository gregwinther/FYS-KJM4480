Quantum Mechanics for Many-Particle Systems

## Project 1: Hartree-Fock
A derivation and comparison of unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) and restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF). Algorithm for self-consistent field (SCF) method is implemented. The UHF and RHF schemes are applied to the $H_2O$ and $H_2$ molecules. The project ends with a discussion fo the divergence for the two schemes for the $H_2$ molecule.
